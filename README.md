Peasy is your collaborative shopping list made easy!

Join with your housemates and create a household shopping list, where everyone can add the items they need to buy.
Select your preferred stores.

Whenever you or a housemate is close to your preferred stores, Peasy will send a reminder to get the items from the list.
Keep your private items in your specific list, only you will see these and only you will receive reminders about them.

## How to use Peasy:

If you want to play around with Peasy, feel free to clone our repo. To start, please enter the following commands on your terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/2006-ghp-capstone-team-B/capstone-b.git
cd capstone-b
npm install
npm start
```

Once you do npm start, a new window will open up on your browser with the expo console. For best results, please run the app on your phone (you will need to download the expo app) or on a simulator (you will be prompted to download it if you don't have any).

When someone has taken care of the shopping, you can easily upload your receipt, scan it, and check-off items from the shared shopping list for easier bill splitting.

## About The Amazing Creators of Peasy:
This app was born as a final project for our fullstack software engineering bootcamp: The Grace Hopper Program from Full Stack Academy. We learned how to develop fullstack applications and then supplemented with a good dose of our own research to come up with a fully functional application that we deemed useful and necessary in our lives.

We are very proud of the result, especially given the short amount of time to learn and apply our knowledge, and are very excited to keep improving it as we grow as professional software engineers.

Feel free to reach out to us if you want to learn more about Peasy and us!
